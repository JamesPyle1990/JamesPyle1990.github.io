I"n<p>A. 
This artifact is a SQLLite backed android application. I created it this week (July 2021). This is a simple app that lets the user add a customer name and age to a database. It also includes a switch to show whether or not they are an active customer or not.</p>

<p>B. 
	I chose this artifact, because I think it shows that I understand how to build an app that works seamlessly with a database. I am showing specific skills as it pertains to a sql database. This artifact is a lot different from what we built in a previous course. I built this from the ground up, but it does enhance the database as it shows more information, the name, age and whether or not they are active.</p>

<p>C. 
I believe I have met the course objectives for this assignment, and I do not plan on any updates.</p>

<p>D. 
	I enjoyed working on this project because I understand a lot more about android studio. When we made our initial apps I had a lot of trouble understanding how to switch between screens and just general problems with the language. I think this application is clean, itâ€™s easy to make sense of and it works as intended.</p>
