I"U<p>A.
The artifact I have chosen for this assignment is a rest api built with flask and python. I created it this week (July 2021). It is a web framework connected to a no sql database called mongo using python and a dependency called flask. With this web framework the user can get and post names from a list on the cloud database.</p>

<p>B. 
This artifact is a good representation of my skills in algorithms and data structures. I am showing that I understand how a database backed rest api works. In a previous term we built a similar project using an entirely different web framework and database. I have enhanced the pervious artifact by creating a similar project with entirely different methods.</p>

<p>C. 
I have met the course objectives through the creation of this project.</p>

<p>D. 
This artifact was particularly difficult because I had to download a new workspace and set it up to create this project. It was done in a virtual environment inside Python. I had to download and set up Python 3.9, Visual Code Studio IDE, flask, pymongo and the mongo atlas database. Once I got everything connected it was a bit easier from there. The biggest problem I faced was connecting the application to the database. I learned a lot about how these languages and frameworks work together because the set up process was so difficult. Although that frustration has led to a deeper understanding, so moving forward Iâ€™m actually glad I had the experience.</p>
