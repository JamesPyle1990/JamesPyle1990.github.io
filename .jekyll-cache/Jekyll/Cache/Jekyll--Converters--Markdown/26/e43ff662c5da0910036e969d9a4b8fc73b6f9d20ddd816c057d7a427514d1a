There is so much to learn and this subject is so deep that I get discouraged and intimidated with new projects and concepts sometimes, but when I look back to when I started, my improvement is massive. I remember speaking to a javascript developer friend in 2016 when I had first embarked on this journey and I didnâ€™t even know simple terms like what an array is, a function, different programming languages, anything. I could even speak in an intelligent way about software development, I just knew I was interested. A lot of the terms I know now seem so commonplace, but itâ€™s important for me to remember where I started, and know that this field requires constant learning. 
There are a lot of jobs in my area that start off in a collaborative team environment, and I feel that I would do well in one of these roles after learning about different approaches, such as waterfall and agile. I donâ€™t have any experience yet in this type of environment, but I am very happy I was exposed to these styles throughout my coursework. 
Communication in general and especially in this field is extremely important to the success of a project. One of the areas I feel I excel in is communicating complex development problems in laymanâ€™s terms. Stakeholders want to know what they are getting and they want it to match their vision. It is the developerâ€™s job to turn that vision into a reality. 
Data structures and algorithms is one of the areas I feel least confident about. Most of the time when I am developing something, I am just trying to make it run without errors. I think the more experience I gain will help me in this field, because using the right data structures and developing a solid algorithm will optimize the program I am working on. 
I have learned a ton about software engineering and databases throughout this program. When I first started, I had no idea about the different types of databases SQL vs. NOSQL, cloud based or internal storage. All of these options dictate how a program will run and it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each one. For instance if I were to use internal storage on an application it would work very quickly and without the need for internet access, but if the user doesnâ€™t have the storage they cannot even use it. 
Security is one the areas I could most improve. This subject is so deep in and of itself and people that try to breach security are very good at what they do. Proper security entails a very specific and intimate knowledge of how your software works to keep it from being exploited. 

All of these artifacts fit together in to a cohesive project that showcases the skills and abilities I have acquired throughout this computer science program. I am very happy with my software and engineering app. It is a plant care app that I developed in android studio. The interface looks great to me, the code is clean and easy to understand and I show skills in java development and android studio. The second artifact is a REST API built in a virtual environment within Python, using the Flask framework linked to a NOSQL database called Mongo. I am also very happy with this program, because it shows that I can link multiple languages and frameworks together to make a backend web development program. My last artifact is an application that I developed in android studio that links SQLite database. With this application I show proficiency in another type of database.
