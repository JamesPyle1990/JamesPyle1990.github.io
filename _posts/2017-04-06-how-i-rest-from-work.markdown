A.	 
This artifact is an app I created an android this past week. It is an app that helps the user care for their house plants. It is a simple, but sleek layout that provides scrollable list of items with images and text. 
 
B.	
I included this artifact because I think it is a good-looking app that is deceptively complicated. Creating a custom layout in android studio is difficult because you must understand how to use a custom adapter. I have shown that I understand how to use this adapter to create good looking applications and easy to follow navigation. 
 
C.	
I believe I have successfully met the software engineering enhancement requirement by creating this app. The code is a lot cleaner and the app functions much better than my previous app. 
 
D.	
Creating this application was frustrating and challenging, but I think what I learned will greatly benefit my future projects. I have always wanted to be able to create apps, the problem I always had was switching between screens, accounting for errors and creating a custom layout. I believe that this app has given me a solid baseline for future app development.
