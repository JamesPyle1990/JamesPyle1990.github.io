This is an app I created in android studio as part of a mobile architecture class. It is an app that helps the user care for their house plants. It is a simple, but sleek layout that provides a scrollable list of items with images and text. I think it is a good-looking app that is deceptively complicated. Creating a custom layout in android studio is difficult because you must understand how to use a custom adapter. 
 Creating this application was frustrating and challenging, but I think what I learned will greatly benefit my future projects. I have always wanted to be able to create apps, the problem I always had was switching between screens, accounting for errors and creating a custom layout. I believe that this app has given me a solid baseline for future app development.
