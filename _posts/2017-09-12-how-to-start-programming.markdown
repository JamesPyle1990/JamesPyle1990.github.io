This project is a SQLLite backed android application. I created in July 2021. It is a simple app that lets the user add a customer name and age to a database. It also includes a switch to show whether or not they are an active customer or not. 


	 I think this project it shows that I understand how to build an app that works seamlessly with a database. I am showing specific skills as it pertains to a sql database. This artifact is a lot different from what we built in a previous course. I built this from the ground up, but it does enhance the database as it shows more information, the name, age and whether or not they are active. 


	I enjoyed working on this project because I understand a lot more about android studio. When we made our initial apps I had a lot of trouble understanding how to switch between screens and just general problems with the language. I think this application is clean, it’s easy to make sense of and it works as intended. 

   Here is a link to the project! https://github.com/JamesPyle1990/JamesPyle1990.github.io/blob/master/CS-499%20Databases.zip
